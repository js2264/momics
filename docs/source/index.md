# momics

`momics` is a Python support library for .momics files. 

The `momics` package aims to facilitate:

* Creation: ingestion of genomic files into `momics` files;
* Querying: sequential and range query patterns and tabular and array retrieval;
* Scalable: cloud-native, out-of-core operations on the data;
* Export: data export.

Follow `momics` development on [GitHub](https://github.com/js2264/momics).
